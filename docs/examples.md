### Natural Language Variations

The MCP server works with various phrasings:

- "Create a task..."
- "I need to remember to..."
- "Put this on my list..."

**Completing todos:**
- "Mark as done..."
- "I finished..."
- "Complete the task..."
- "Check off..."

**Updating todos:**
- "Change the priority..."
- "Update the description..."
- "Modify the todo..."
- "Edit the task..."

### Contextual Conversations

**Reference previous todos:**
```
"Remember that presentation I added yesterday? Update it to include the quarterly results."
```

**Batch operations:**
```
"I completed all my morning tasks. Mark the email review, standup meeting, and coffee preparation as done."
```

**Smart suggestions:**
```
"Based on my current workload, what should I focus on today? Also, are there any overdue items I should prioritize?"
```

These examples showcase the flexibility and power of the MCP Todo Server when integrated with AI assistants. The natural language interface makes todo management intuitive and efficient.
